# PlayIt
Borah Chong, Hannah Nichols, Kail Walker
Professor: Peter Bui

In-class project that involved using a SQL database to organize data and search through it. Also involved using HTML, Javascirpt, and Python to create website to run program on. The final website played back music as well. This was an upgrade to the SearchIt project. The music itself it not included in the repository. 

The README file inside the PLAYIT folder contains information provided to us by the professor and some of the sources that we used. 

Similar to the SearchIt project, the code skeleton was provided to us by the professor, and the main parts of the code were filled in by us.
